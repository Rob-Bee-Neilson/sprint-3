What is you site's primary purpose?
    To display my progress through EDA.
Who is your target audience?
    Fellow students, teachers, and other interested parties
How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
    I'd like visitors to have a clean + intuitive interaction with the site. I'd like the visitor to barely notice the site as the content is presented so clearly.
How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
    Simplicity. Clear boxy format, simple tree structure with fore-thought to future development e.g. projects to come, where they will fit in. Easy to read font. Style to focus on the text.
